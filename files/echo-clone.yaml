      summary: Create resource
      description: >-
        A demonstration of a POST call based on the echo backend above. The
        request body is expected to contain JSON-formatted data (see example
        below). A policy is used to automatically transform any request sent in
        JSON directly to XML. In a real-world scenario this could be used to
        enable modern clients to speak to a legacy backend.

    delete:
      summary: Remove resource
      description: >-
        A demonstration of a DELETE call which traditionally deletes the
        resource. It is based on the same "echo" backend as in all other
        operations so nothing is actually deleted.

    put:
      summary: Modify Resource
      description: >-
        A demonstration of a PUT call handled by the same "echo" backend as
        above. You can now specify a request body in addition to headers and it
        will be returned as well.

    get:
      summary: Retrieve resource
      description: >-
        A demonstration of a GET call on a sample resource. It is handled by an
        "echo" backend which returns a response equal to the request (the
        supplied headers and body are being returned as received).

            A sample parameter that is required and has a default value of
            "sample".

          description: Returned in all cases.
    head:
      summary: Retrieve header only
      description: >-
        The HEAD operation returns only headers. In this demonstration a policy
        is used to set additional headers when the response is returned and to
        enable JSONP.

  /resource-cached:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve resource (cached)
      description: >-
        A demonstration of a GET call with caching enabled on the same "echo"
        backend as above. Cache TTL is set to 1 hour. When you make the first
        request the headers you supplied will be cached. Subsequent calls will
        return the same headers as the first time even if you change them in
        your request.
